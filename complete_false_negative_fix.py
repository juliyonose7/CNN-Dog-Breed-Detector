"""
Complete False Negative Correction Plan for Breed Classification.

This module provides comprehensive strategies and implementation code for
reducing false negative rates in breed classification, particularly for
problematic breeds like Lhasa, Cairn, Siberian Husky, and Whippet.

Strategies Covered:
    1. Immediate threshold adjustment (no retraining)
    2. Specialized data augmentation
    3. Weighted/Focal loss retraining
    4. Ensemble methods

Output:
    - immediate_false_negative_fix.py: Ready-to-use threshold correction script
    - Roadmap and recommendations for systematic improvement

Target Performance:
    - Lhasa: 46% -> <20% false negatives
    - Cairn: 41% -> <20% false negatives
    - Siberian Husky: 38% -> <15% false negatives
    - Whippet: 36% -> <15% false negatives
